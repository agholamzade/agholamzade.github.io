I am a PhD student in Computational Neurosciece  <a href='https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/computational-neuroscience'>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics</a>. I am working on my master's thesis under the supervision of <a href = "https://www.noorsajid.com/page_1">Dr. Noor Sajid</a> and <a href= "https://www.mpg.de/12309370/biological-cybernetics-dayan">Prof. Peter Dayan </a>. 
<br/>
My current research focuses on understanding human decision-making, particularly in environments with a gradual increase in complexity. Iâ€™m also interested in developing methods to enhance the adaptability and generalization of reinforcement-learning agents by using insights from human decision-making models.
