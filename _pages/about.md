I am a Master's student in Neural Information Processing at the  <a href='https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/computational-neuroscience'>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics</a> and <a href='https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de'> University of TÃ¼bingen</a>. I am working on my master's thesis under the supervision of <a href = "https://www.noorsajid.com/page_1">Dr. Noor Sajid</a> and <a href= "https://www.mpg.de/12309370/biological-cybernetics-dayan">Prof. Peter Dayan </a>. My thesis project explores how optimal transport theory can be applied to enable online transformation between distinct outcome modalities for downstream decision-making tasks.

My current research interests are learning and memory, especially in the context of spatial navigation. When I am not in lab, I enjoy writing popular science blogs. Besides, I love running, reading, cooking, and playing puzzles in my free time.
